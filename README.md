# Bitcoin Cows Bounties

Open bounties can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoincows/bounties/issues). Bounties may be raised over time.

# Solving Bounties
You will receive the bounty in crypto currency if you are the first to:
- Provide a working Github Repository
- Test Cases included that are sufficient to evaluate the project
- You license your repository open source like Public Domain, MIT (ask if you need to use other licenses due to software dependency)

# Suggest a new bounty
Add a new issue under the "bounty idea" tag. Suggest how much funding would be needed and wether you want to contribute yourself to the bounty or not. Once the first bounty reward is added by the team or others it will be added under the "bounty" tag.

# Raising Bounties as a third party
If you want to contribute to raising bountie rewards leave a comment under the issue. We will get in touch and escrow the funds. In the future we will try making this process smoother.
