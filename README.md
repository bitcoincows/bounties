# Bitcoin Cows Bounties

Open bounties can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoincows/bounties/issues). Bounties may be raised over time and can be used for all kind of things, even programming unrelated like creating memes.

# Solving Bounties
You will receive the bounty in crypto currency if you are the first to:
- Provide a working Github Repository with substanstial work of your own
- Test cases included that are sufficient to evaluate the project
- You license your repository open source like Public Domain, MIT (ask if you need to use other licenses due to software dependency)

You will receive the bounty if 2 out of 4 team members judge your work as sufficient and you are the first to do so.

# Suggest a new bounty
Add a new issue under the "bounty idea" tag. Suggest how much funding would be needed and wether you want to contribute yourself to the bounty or not. Once the first bounty reward is added by the team or others it will be added under the "bounty" tag.

# Raising Bounties as a third party
If you want to contribute to raising bounty rewards leave a comment under the issue. Only bounty provided and guaranteed by the team will appear in the title. Bounties by a third party will be added to the description, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive them from the third party.
